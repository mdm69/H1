Homework One 

Requirements
The purpose of this homework is to help you warm up with HTML and CSS.
Imaging that you are a blogger and you constantly publish insights 
regarding tech companies. Your website has a subscription function that 
allows people to register your website and gain more insights. Given the 
above context, please create a simple mockup signup page with CSS 
styling. 
Requirement 1 (80%): Your page should have the following components:
1. Introduction about you and what you do.
2. On the same page, you create the following text fields asking for the 
following information:
1. First name, Last name, Email, Hometown, Major
2. A sign-up page should have one button: subscribe. Here, the 
buttons do not need to work.
Requirement 2 (15%): Aesthetics
You must use CSS to style your page and it looks polished (this is 
subjective, but you probably know what a good or bad website looks like.)
Requirement 3 (5%): Better practices
Here, we will focus on the quality of your code, such as using external CSS
Note: You do not need to use “form tag”, you can only use the tags 
mentioned in our first lecture. You simply use html&CSS for this homework.
